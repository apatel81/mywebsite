I am a 1st year Master's of Applied Statistics Major and at UCLA. I graduated in June 2021 from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and a Minor in Data Science. I am seeking job opportunities to apply my statistical knowledge as a statistical or data analyst in hopes of making your company better in any aspect that I can help in. Ultimately, one day I hope to apply my statistical knowledge in the Sports Industry and help sports teams become more efficient. My work ethic and competitive nature will make me an asset to your company.
